In the Last Lecture video, Randy really got me thinking. If I had been diagnosed with a terminal disease and had a number put to my days, would I be satisfied with what my life has become? It's so grim to think about, but for me personally it's not like it would be entirely impossible. My family, on my mother's side, has a deep history of cancer and various other diseases. Cancer took the life of my grandmother, almost took the life of my aunt, and is about to take the life of my grandfather. My own mom has had plenty of scares in recent years as well. I've always been weary of this especially growing up, having to tell doctors at every visit about my family history, but watching Randy speak about all the crazy things he's experienced while being terminally ill really twisted the knife of the fact that I do not by any means have an adventurous or wild life. I've always been a homebody and preferred my bedroom. Randy Pausch truly lived with a purpose. I guess what I'm really saying is that life is short and only a one time thing, and that I should take more opportunities and make the most of it, because you truly never know what sort of wicked curveball could be thrown at you. I think Randy created a sense of urgency in his speech, and definitely more so by leaving with quite a legacy behind him. It definitely urged me to think about what I'm really doing with my life, especially since it's not too far off from home.
